# Flight Basics

The pilot frame uses six-direction motion with simple combat rhythm.

- `W / S`: forward and reverse thrust
- `Mouse movement`: steer ship heading (yaw + pitch)
- `A / D`: lateral strafe
- `R / F`: climb and descend thrusters
- `Q / E`: reserved for future actions
- `Shift`: temporary speed boost
- `Space`: fire mining projectile
- `Esc`: pause or resume 3D simulation for UI interaction

## Camera Behavior

The camera rides behind the ship and continuously tracks your forward vector.
This keeps target acquisition clear even while strafing.
