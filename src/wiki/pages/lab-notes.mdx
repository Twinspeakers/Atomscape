# Laboratory Notes

The lab is now a process simulator with station power, beneficiation, chemistry, manufacturing, and crew support controls.

## Station Tick Systems

Every second the simulation runs:

- station charging (if enabled and in range)
- containment power drain (if enabled)
- plasma recombination (ionized H to neutral H)
- crew survival (hunger/thirst/debuff progression with automation)

Docking forces station distance to `0 m`, and charging stops automatically if distance exceeds `50 m`.

## Resource Flow

1. Mine asteroids into rubble.
2. Sort rubble into silica, iron ore, ice, CO2 ice, carbon rock, and slag.
3. Run water and gas chemistry (melter, electrolyzer, ionizer).
4. Refine and manufacture glass, steel, cellulose, and wood.

## Crew + Fridge

- Open `Game Menu > Crew` (hotkey `C`) for per-member status and automation controls.
- `Feed The Crew` quest reward unlocks the fridge and preloads 5 Galaxy Bars.
- Galaxy Bar consumption priority is `Fridge -> Cargo`.
- Water automation consumes water when thirst thresholds are crossed.

## Atom Counter

The Atom Counter tab totals H/C/O/Si/Fe across all stored compounds.
Balanced recipes move atoms between containers instead of creating or destroying matter.
