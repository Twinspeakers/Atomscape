# Asteroid Mining

Asteroids are rendered as high-contrast white spheres around the ship.
Your mining laser now consumes ship energy and yields **rubble**, not pure elements.

## Selection

Clicking an asteroid tags it in the object panel and displays:

- range from ship
- dominant spectral element signature
- integrity estimate

## Destruction And Yield

Projectile collision removes the asteroid and adds rubble chunks.
Rubble is a mixed feedstock that must be processed in the laboratory rock sorter.

## Respawn Loop

A fresh asteroid is spawned after each successful mine so the field stays active.
This keeps exploration and beneficiation continuous.
