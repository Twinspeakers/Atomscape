# MVP Spec v1

## Intent
Deliver a playable, scientifically grounded first loop where the player converts space waste into useful products, sustains crew, and earns currency.

## Core Player Loop
1. Mine rubble/salvage (high energy cost).
2. Sort and process in Laboratory.
3. Craft first item (primary MVP win).
4. Sell products in Store for credits.
5. Produce Galaxy Bars for crew survival.

## MVP Outcomes
- First crafted item achieved.
- First sale completed.
- Crew fed via Galaxy Bar chain.

## Mandatory Systems
- Mining + energy drain emphasis.
- Lab processing with both:
  - recipe list
  - node graph view
- Crafting outputs:
  - Box of Sand
  - Steel Ingot
  - Energy Cell
- Store pricing:
  - fluctuates with supply/demand
- Crew system:
  - starvation applies soft debuffs
- Failure system:
  - return to start for repairs
  - repairs consume minor resources

## Automation Rules (Early Game)
- Food production gets early automation first.
- Atom/compound production automation unlocks shortly after.

## UI Visibility Requirements
- Always visible at gameplay level:
  - Energy
  - Inventory
  - Crew status
  - Objectives

## Non-Goals (MVP)
- Full "make anything on Earth" catalog.
- Deep late-game industrial chains.
- Hard-fail survival penalties.
